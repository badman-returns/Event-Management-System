The entry point of this application is server.ts. This file creates an instance of the app and starts listening on given specific port. In the `app.ts`, routing, intializing middleware and initializing database tables is done.
Inside the src folder we have the configs folder containing files that store configuration variables. The database folder contains a file where the database tables are created and master data is inserted. Next the interface folder contains custom generated types which is used across the application. The middleware folder contains middlewares which is used for accessing protected routes and also login. 
Inside the model folder all the database model files are present that contain queries for respected database operations. 
The routes folder has been divided into admin and public with each of them having their routing and controllers in it and the utility folder contains utilities.
